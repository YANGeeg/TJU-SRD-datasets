EEG datasets for stereogram recognition of Tianjin University, China
1: Summary
1.1 overview
SRDA and SRDB are two EEG based stereogram recognition datasets, which contain 24 dynamic random dot stereograms (DRDS) with three categories of different parallax. The two databases are mainly different from SRDA, which adopts high-contrast DRDS, and SRDB, which adopts low-contrast DRDS. These graphics are presented on the 3D display in the form of DRDS videos. Subjects recognize different types of stereograms when wearing 3D glasses.
